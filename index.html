<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p> There is no school subject quite as divisive as mathematics; people seem to either love or hate the subject.
    We believe this is, in part, due to the way mathematics is taught. Mathematics education still relies
    heavily on the same traditional lecture-style of mathematics, which fails to adequately support 
    those with different learning styles. This is where technology needs to come into play - as an 
    optimization for mathematics education to help support students of different learning styles while
    propelling the perspective of the subject forward. We hope these visual and auditory tools spur some
    ideas for improving mathematics education!</p>
    <p>This is our WiCHacks submission, emphasizing the beauty of visualizing and even hearing math!</p>
