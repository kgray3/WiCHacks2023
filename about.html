<h2>About the Authors</h2>

<h3>Kayla Gray</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Kayla Gray and I am finishing up my last semester of my senior year at SUNY Oswego.
    I am double-majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. Apart from taking classes, I
    currently TA for two computer science courses: CSC212 Principles of Programming and 
    CSC344 Programming Languages. I also am Vice President of Women in Computing and Math Club 
    at SUNY Oswego. As a part of the honors program, I have been researching and writing a thesis on
    algorithmic music composition, hence why I worked on "Mathesthesia" for this project - it was 
    a fun blend of my love for math, music, and computer science! After
    I graduate, I plan on working in the industry as a Software Engineer.

<h3>Maddie Bauso</h3>
<p>I'm Maddie and I'm a senior about to graduate in May. I'm a Computer Science major and Math 
	and Graphic Design minor. I have a strong interest in the overlap between computer science, 
	art, and math and this influenced our visual emphasis in this WiCHacks project. I am open to 
	a wide variety of avenues that use my various areas of study, especially those involving the web.

<h3>Vicky Liu</h3>
<p>I'm currently a senior at SUNY Oswego, majoring in Computer Science with a Cogntive Science minor. 
    I use to see Art as a gateaway from the systematic and rational space that I'm used to and 
    able to enjoy something unreasoned. But in this project we combined both art and math to show that
    really anything can be art.
